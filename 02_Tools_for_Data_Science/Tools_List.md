## âœ… Key Observations

- **Jupyter** and **Watson Studio** were the most hands-on in the course and will likely be used in future projects.
- **Git & GitHub** are essential for collaboration and professional portfolio building.
- Tools like **Spark**, **Kafka**, and **HDFS** are more relevant in big data/enterprise-level environments.
