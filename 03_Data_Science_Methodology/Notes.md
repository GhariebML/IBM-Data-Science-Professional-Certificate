## üîÅ The 10 Steps (Explained)

### 1. Business Understanding
- Define the problem in business terms
- Key question: What does the client want?

### 2. Analytic Approach
- Determine whether the problem is descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive
- Choose appropriate analytical techniques (classification, clustering, etc.)

### 3. Data Requirements
- Decide what data is needed to solve the problem (structured/unstructured, internal/external)

### 4. Data Collection
- Identify sources and begin gathering data (e.g., APIs, databases, sensors, web scraping)

### 5. Data Understanding
- Explore data using statistics and visualizations to spot trends, gaps, or outliers

### 6. Data Preparation
- Clean, transform, normalize, and merge datasets as needed
- Often, the most time-consuming phase

### 7. Modeling
- Apply chosen machine learning or statistical models
- Training and tuning the model

### 8. Evaluation
- Assess model performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Decide if the model meets business goals

### 9. Deployment
- Make the model or solution available to stakeholders or end users
- Could involve APIs, apps, dashboards, or reports

### 10. Feedback
- Monitor solution performance
- Collect feedback to improve future iterations

## üß† Reflections

- A solid methodology avoids chaos ‚Äî it helps turn messy data into useful insights
- Business understanding and feedback are often overlooked but are **critical**
- Every project I work on from now on will follow this structured process
