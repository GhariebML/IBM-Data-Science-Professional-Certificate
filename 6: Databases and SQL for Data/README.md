# 🗄️ Databases and SQL for Data Science

This is the sixth course in the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). In this course, I learned how to work with SQL and relational databases, a critical skill in accessing and manipulating structured data for analysis.

## 📚 Course Summary

The course introduces the basics of relational databases and focuses on how to use **SQL** to query data. It covers foundational commands, how to filter, sort, join tables, use subqueries, create views, and work with real-world datasets using **Jupyter Notebooks**.

- Basic SQL syntax: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- Using logical operators: `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- Table joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- Creating and modifying tables using `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Subqueries, aliases, and views
- Hands-on SQL querying in Jupyter with **SQL magic (%sql)**
